**What’s Inside the Repository**

**Project 1** —** Hand Drawing:** A real-time drawing application using webcam input where hand landmarks detected by MediaPipe drive on-screen drawing. Users can move a finger in front of the camera to draw lines, mimicking a virtual paint tool using gesture tracking via OpenCV + MediaPipe. 
GitHub

**Project 2** —** Hand Calculator:** An interactive calculator driven by hand gestures. This project interprets specific finger positions or gestures to perform basic arithmetic operations (e.g., counting fingers as input). The application processes the webcam feed in real time and uses MediaPipe to detect and classify hand poses for input. 
GitHub

**Technology Stack**

OpenCV: Used for video capture, frame processing, and display. 
PyResearch

MediaPipe: Provides real-time detection and tracking of hand landmarks from the webcam feed. 
arXiv

Python: All code is implemented in Python, leveraging both OpenCV and MediaPipe Python APIs. 
GitHub

**Typical Use Case**
These projects demonstrate practical applications of hand-pose detection and gesture recognition — two common real-time computer vision tasks — useful for interactive UI experiments, gesture-driven apps, and learning fundamentals of vision-based human-computer interaction.
